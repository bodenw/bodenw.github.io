Alright, let’s face it, we all make mistakes. At some point or another we just need to do a little Ctrl + z and pretend like what we did never happened. In building out this site, I made such a mistake. I made some changes to some files that I just decided I didn’t want. So, it was a great time to do a little Ctrl + z with git.

First, I wanted to make sure that I know what I messed up.

$ git status

![git status shows a file deletion, filed modified, and filed added]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/1.gif)

Is a helpful command for comparing the changes that you have made in your repository that have not been yet committed. Here I saw that I deleted a file, modified a file, and created a new file. I actually did not delete and create new files, I just renamed it.  However, from git’s perspective it appears to be a deletion and addition of a file.

Once I confirmed that I wanted to undo the all the changes shown, I ran

$ git reset --hard

Then, I checked the status again to make sure that it actually worked

$ git status

![git status shows only the file added]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/2.gif)

I saw that the deleted file and the modified file changes have been reverted, but my new file was still showing up. This is because it was untracked by git. The reset did not know what to do with it, so it just left it there. That was nice, but not exactly what I wanted. So, to clean up the untracked file I had to do one more thing.

$ git clean –f

This command can be used to remove untracked files. If you have directories that you have added and want to remove you can also include –d. If you have made changes to your .gitignored files, you can add –x to get them back to their original state.

One last

$ git status

![git status shows there are no changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/3.gif)

Confirms that the workspace is back to its original clean glory!
