title: Git Undo
---

Alright, let’s face it, we all make mistakes. At some point or another we just need to do a little Ctrl + z and pretend like what we did never happened. In building out this site, I made such a mistake. I made some changes to some files that I just decided I don’t want. Now it is time to do a little Ctrl + z with git.

First, I wanted to make sure that I know what I messed up.

$ git status

Is a helpful command for comparing the changes that you have made in your repository that have not been yet committed. Here I see that I deleted a file, modified a file, and created a new file. I actually did not delete and create new files, I just renamed it.  However, from git’s perspective it appears to be a deletion and addition of a file.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/1.gif)

Once you have confirmed that you want to undo the uncommitted changes, start by running 

$ git reset --hard 

Now, we will check the status again to make sure that our changes have been removed.

$ git status

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/2.gif)

We see that the deleted file and the modified file changes have been reverted, but our new file is still showing up. This is because it is untracked by git. the reset does not know what to do with it, so it just leaves it there. That is nice, but not exactly what we wanted. So, to clean up the untracked file we have to do one more thing.

$ git clean –f

This command is used to remove untracked files. If you have directories that you have added and want to remove you can also include –d. If you have made changes to your .gitignored files, you can add –x to get them back to their original state.

One last 

$ git status

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git-undo/3.gif)

Confirms that the workspace is back to its original clean glory!
